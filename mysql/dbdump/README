Command dbdump saves contents of tables in a given MySQL database to
per-table CSV files with optional gzip compression.

dbdump saves either specified or all database tables which are readable by
the connected user; if only subset of table columns is readable, only these
readable columns are saved.

By default program concurrenlty reads multiple tables over multiple
connections (see -n flag), if consistency between dumped tables is required,
use -tx flag to save them sequentially in a single transaction.

MySQL credentials (user and password) are read from the "client" section of
the .my.cnf file which is expected to have the following format:

    [client]
    user = username
    password = password

If -tls flag is used, program connects to the server over TLS and expects
server certificate to be signed with certificate authority from the system
CA pool. On UNIX systems the environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE and
SSL_CERT_DIR can be used to override the system default locations for the
SSL certificate file and SSL certificate files directory, respectively.

When running in concurrent mode, program only returns when all tables are
processed reporting the first encountered error. When running in a single
transaction mode (-tx flag), program terminates on the first error right
away.

Only database, table and column names that can be used as unquoted MySQL
identifiers are supported â€” they are only allowed to contain characters from
[A-Za-z0-9_] range.

Null values are saved in CSV as NULL.
